The grand contact syncer
------------------------

Hi there! This tool is in it's infancy. It currently shows you your google contacts list on the left, and facebook on the right. If it doesn't work, check you are signed into chrome and into facebook, and have facebook language set to English.

Wait for everything to load, then click "Merge!". All facebook contacts will be copied to google (in a label to keep them seperate). You can then use googles merge tool to merge dupliates. The merge tool takes about an hour to detect dupes.

Based on the Google Contacts example extension.
